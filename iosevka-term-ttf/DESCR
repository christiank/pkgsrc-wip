Iosevka is a slender monospace sans-serif and slab-serif typeface inspired
by Pragmata Pro, M+ and PF DIN Mono, designed to be the ideal font for
programming.

This package is "Terminal" variant.

Exact monospaced font without ligatures and full-width glyphs. Since some
environments cannot interpret Iosevka as monospaced, and have difficulties
with ligatures included, you can use Iosevka Term as an alternative.
