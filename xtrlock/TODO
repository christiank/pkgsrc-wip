xtrlock is a very minimal X display lock program, which uses
nothing except the Xlib library. It doesn't obscure the screen,
it is completely idle while the display is locked and you don't
type at it, and it doesn't do funny things to the X access control
lists.

* The package is tested on NetBSD i386 and amd64. Testing on Linux
or other systems needs still be done. 

* Is there a workaround for the setuid bit to lock the screen?
