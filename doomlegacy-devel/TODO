Part 1: Port to NetBSD
======================
Build system doesn't support NetBSD.

[X] Sent patches to upstream
[X] Imported proposed patchset from upstream
    => PKGREVISION not bumped, because binary package has not changed
[X] Renamed man page template to doomlegacy.1.in (suggested by wiz@)
    => PKGREVISION not bumped, because binary package has not changed
[X] Move man page to section 6 (it's a game)
   => Bump PKGREVISION
[X] Test building of the package again
    => Tested to work with SVN revision 1448
[X] Remove NetBSD specific patches after upstream integration

Part 1 finished.


Part 2: Fix large blockmaps on big endian machines
==================================================
On my Apple Power Mac G5 some modern (large) maps fail to load with errors like:
| 
| Error: Blockmap offset[5556]= -32745, exceeds bounds.

This bug looks not security relevant, because the code catches it and gracefully
terminate the engine.

[X] Update to SVN revision 1453
    => Problem still exist
[X] Rework pkgsrc patches rejected by upstream (disable launcher and keyboard
    setup +/- for automap zoom) for SVN revision 1453
[X] Add patch for (int16_t) integer overflow while loading Blockmap
    Note: This should never happen on little endian machines
    => PKGREVISION not bumped (SVN based packages use build date in version)
[X] Sent Blockmap patch to upstream (Bug #653)
[X] Imported proposed patchset d42_blockmap_endian.diff from upstream
    => Drop former pkgsrc patch
    => PKGREVISION not bumped (SVN based packages use build date in version)
    => Works as expected (Reported in bugtracker for #653)
[X] Patches merged in SVN revision 1456
[X] Remove corresponding pkgsrc patches after upstream integration

Part 2 finished.


Part 3: Torches are displayed crippled with software renderer
=============================================================
This problem was not present in 1.47.2, maybe a side effect of OpenGL corona
changes since last release. Can be tested with:
| 
|    $ doomlegacy -iwad doom2.wad -warp 5

(walk through the opening and look at the torch in front of you)

Already reported upstream as Bug #652 (not present in OpenGL mode and really
a side effect of the corona code changes).

Suggested workaround: Deactivating coronas by going to:

  "Options -> Effects Options -> Light Options"

Set "Corona" option to "Off" (verified to work on NetBSD).

Other workaround: It seems that only the option "Corona_Draw" set to "Additive"
is problematic. Coronas with other settings work.

[X] Test patch d41_draw8_alpha.diff from upstream
    Patch not released yet
    => Patch merged in SVN revision 1455
    => Works as expected with SVN revision 1458

Part 3 finished.


Part 4: Problem with loading compressed blockmaps
=================================================
Some compressed blockmaps can interfere with the overflow detection.

[X] Reported upstream as Bug #654
[X] Fixed in SVN revision 1460
    => Works as expected (Reported in bugtracker for #654)

Part 4 finished.


Part 5: Rendering problems on big endian machine
================================================
On some maps the rendering is broken (only in parts of the map).

[X] Reported upstream as Bug #655
[X] Update to SVN revision 1473
    => Problem is only partly fixed (for some maps)
       Bug #655 was a big endian problem, now fixed
    => Rendering problems with other map are unrelated
       Ticket #657 opened for them
       Looks like the bugs are in the level data, not in the engine

Part 5 finished.


Part 6: Import final release
============================

[ ] Import version 1.48
    Not released yet
