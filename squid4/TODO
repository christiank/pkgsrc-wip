- Firstly these patches aren't needed on 64 bit system. Needed on 32bit system
  only. Further these are just quick fixes. Can be improved and shared
  upstream.

     patch-src_acl_external_kerberos__ldap__group_support__resolv.cc
     patch-src_fs_ufs_RebuildState.h

- Need to get rc script related code from squid3 makefile

- Need to get (at least) those options available in squid3 here (first checking
  whether each one is still supported)

- ssl option needs to be checked for compatibility with NetBSD >= 8.99 as ssl
  has been upgraded

- Other cosmetics
