Guile-Reader is a simple framework for building readers for GNU Guile.

The idea is to make it easy to build procedures that extend Guile's
read procedure. Readers supporting various syntax variants can easily
be written, possibly by re-using existing "token readers" of a
standard Scheme readers. For example, it is used to implement
Skribilo's R5RS-derived document syntax.

Guile-Reader's approach is similar to Common Lisp's "read table", but
hopefully more powerful and flexible (for instance, one may
instantiate as many readers as needed).
