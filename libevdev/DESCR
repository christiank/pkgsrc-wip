Wrapper library for /dev/input/eventX listens to keyboard and mouse
events. Maps codes and names. Finds buttons and LEDs. Checks the
resolution, repeat delay and period. Modifies appearance and capability
bits. Transparently synchronizes when the process does not read events
fast enough and the kernel is forced to drop some events.
