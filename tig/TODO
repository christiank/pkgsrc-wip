- Add a comment about patches/patch-include_tig_tig.h
- Some graphical artifacts (e.g. where `main' and `diff' views are present)
  should be investigated and fixed, to reproduce them:
   + press enter 
   + press down arrow
  After that the `main' view is mostly completely blank except for the current
  two entries.
  patch-src_view.c workarounds that.
- Investigate why curses could not be initialized when `TERM= dumb', tig fails
  with `tig: Failed to initialize curses'.  `test' target ATM is also not very
  useful due that.
- configure insists to check readline version... Investigate if it's possible to
  use mk/readline.buildlink3.mk instead.
