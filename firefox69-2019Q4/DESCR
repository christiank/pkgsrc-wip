This is essentially www/firefox (69.0.1) from pkgsrc-2019Q3.
It installs as firefox, not firefox69, so it can directly replace
www/firefox.

Because it failed to build for me when I tried to in the context of
2019-Q4, I randomly hacked on it until it did. I wanted to build it
because the normal firefox in 2019-Q4 is broken (about:logins, the saved
login page shows no logins), and you can't downgrade versions to
www/firefox68 (which did build).

In particular, ff 69 had build failures like this (and many more):

error[E0204]: the trait `Copy` may not be implemented for this type
    --> /pkg_comp/obj/pkgsrc/www/firefox69/default/build/x86_64-unknown-netbsd/release/build/style-cfb58b4e6cf6f71b/out/gecko/structs.rs:4399:29

What worked in the end was to copy the rust bindgen crate 0.49.4 from
www/firefox68 into this firefox, but pretending to be 0.49.3, which
is what it expects. I had to adjust some version numbers here and there,
and because of that, SHA256 sums as well.

=====================================================================

Mozilla Firefox is a free, open-source and cross-platform web browser
for Windows, Linux, MacOS X and many other operating systems.

It is fast and easy to use, and offers many advantages over other web
browsers, such as tabbed browsing and the ability to block pop-up
windows.

Firefox also offers excellent bookmark and history management, and it
can be extended by developers using industry standards such as XML,
CSS, JavaScript, C++, etc. Many extensions are available.
