Gollum is a simple wiki system built on top of Git that powers GitHub
Wikis.

Gollum-lib is the Ruby API that allows you to retrieve raw or
formatted wiki content from a Git repository, write new content to the
repository, and collect various meta data about the wiki as a whole.

Gollum-lib follows the rules of Semantic Versioning and uses TomDoc
for inline documentation.
