This package is a testbed for making module-based builds work.

Building and installing works, but all module files are downloaded into a flat
directory named after the package. Ideally, we would want a dynamic
subdirectory based on the path in GO_MODULE_FILES. Otherwise, there will be
clashes when multiple packages have the same version.
