Sanitize is a whitelist-based HTML and CSS sanitizer. Given a list of
acceptable elements, attributes, and CSS properties, Sanitize will
remove all unacceptable HTML and/or CSS from a string.

Using a simple configuration syntax, you can tell Sanitize to allow
certain HTML elements, certain attributes within those elements, and
even certain URL protocols within attributes that contain URLs. You
can also whitelist CSS properties, @ rules, and URL protocols you wish
to allow in elements or attributes containing CSS. Any HTML or CSS
that you don't explicitly allow will be removed.

Sanitize is based on Google's Gumbo HTML5 parser, which parses HTML
exactly the same way modern browsers do, and Crass, which parses CSS
exactly the same way modern browsers do. As long as your whitelist
config only allows safe markup and CSS, even the most malformed or
malicious input will be transformed into safe output.
