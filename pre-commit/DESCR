It is a multi-language package manager for pre-commit hooks. You specify a
list of hooks you want and pre-commit manages the installation and
execution of any hook written in any language before every
commit. pre-commit is specifically designed to not require root access. If
one of your developers doesn't have node installed but modifies a
JavaScript file, pre-commit automatically handles downloading and building
node to run eslint without root.
