Amp is a text editor which is heavily inspired by Vi/Vim. It aims to
take the core interaction model of Vim, simplify it, and bundle in the
essential features required for a modern text editor.

Its features include:
- File Finder: Quickly indexes and finds files using a simple, accurate
  matching algorithm. Ignores git directories by default; easily
  configurable to your own liking, if you must.
- Easy Movement: Fast, precise cursor movement without repetitive
  keystrokes or fancy expressions. Look where you'd like to move, and
  type the token. That's it.
- Symbol Jump: Move to any class, struct, or method definition within
  the current buffer. Easily augment the default set of supported
  languages using the .sublime-syntax format.
- Flexible Keymaps: Simple YAML-based key mappings with the ability to
  compose multiple built-in commands into new, custom macros.
