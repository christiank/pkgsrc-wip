Nix is a purely functional package manager. This means that it treats
packages like values in purely functional programming languages such as
Haskell-they are built by functions that don't have side-effects, and they
never change after they have been built. Nix stores packages in the Nix
store, usually the directory /nix/store, where each package has its own unique
sub-directory.
